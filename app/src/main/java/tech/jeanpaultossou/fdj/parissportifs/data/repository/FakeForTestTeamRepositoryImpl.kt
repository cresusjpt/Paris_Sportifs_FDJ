Fondé à Lille en septembre 1944, il est issu de la fusion de deux clubs basés dans différents quartiers de la ville, l'Olympique lillois et le Sporting Club fivois respectivement créés en 1902 et 1901.\r\n\r\nFort du passé de l'Olympique lillois, vainqueur du premier championnat de France professionnel en 1933, le LOSC est la référence d'après-guerre. En dix ans, le club lillois gagne deux titres de champion de France et cinq coupes de France. Mais ne pouvant plus faire face à ses dettes malgré de nombreuses subventions, le club traverse une longue période difficile, avec plusieurs relégations en Division 2, avant d'échouer en troisième division et d'abandonner son statut professionnel en 1969. Remontant en D2 la saison qui suit, le club est financièrement soutenu avant d'être repris par la mairie de Lille en 1980 sous la forme d'une société d'économie mixte. Le LOSC est privatisé en 1999 après avoir frôlé le dépôt de bilan en 1994. Cette privatisation s'accompagne de résultats sportifs positifs : solidement ancré en Ligue 1 depuis la promotion et le titre de champion de deuxième division en 2000, le club se qualifie régulièrement pour les coupes d'Europe actuelles que sont la Ligue des champions ou la Ligue Europa et réalise le doublé championnat-coupe de France lors de la saison 2010-2011.\r\n\r\nLe club est présidé depuis 2002 par Michel Seydoux, actionnaire majoritaire du club depuis 2004. Les Dogues, surnom attribué aux joueurs évoluant sous le maillot du club, sont entraînés depuis l'été 2013 par René Girard.\r\n\r\nJouant d'abord en alternance dans les stades des deux clubs fusionnés, le LOSC décide plus tard de ne recevoir ses adversaires qu'au stade Victor-Boucquey de l'Olympique lillois, renommé stade Henri-Jooris jusqu'à sa démolition en 1975. Le stade Grimonprez-Jooris a ensuite accueilli jusqu'en 2004 dans Lille intra-muros les rencontres à domicile du club nordiste. Pendant huit ans, le Lille OSC s'est installé provisoirement dans le Stadium Lille Métropole de Villeneuve-d'Ascq puis a emménagé lors de la saison 2012-2013 au stade Pierre-Mauroy, un des cinq plus grands stades de France, également situé à Villeneuve-d'Ascq.

Il évolue depuis 1989 en Ligue 1.\r\n\r\nL'Olympique lyonnais évolue dans le Stade de Gerland et s'entraîne au centre Tola Vologe, à Lyon. Il possède à son palmarès sept titres - obtenus consécutivement - de champion de France, cinq Coupes de France et une Coupe de la Ligue, ce qui en fait l'un des clubs les plus titrés du championnat de France.\r\n\r\nLe club connaît son apogée au cours des années 2000 avec sept titres consécutifs de champion de France, ce qui constitue un record françaisnote 2, entre 2002 et 2008, une Coupe de France et une Coupe de la Ligue. La section féminine du club a remporté quant à elle le championnat féminin à neuf reprisesnote 3. En 2007, les sections masculines et féminines remportent chacune leur championnat de France, pour la première fois dans l'histoire du football français. En 2008, l’Olympique lyonnais fait mieux en remportant les deux doublés coupe-championnat, homme et femme. Depuis le milieu des années 2000, la section féminine occupe les plus hauts niveaux du football féminin européen (2 titres successifs en Ligue des champions).\r\n\r\nSur le plan international, le club participe régulièrement à la plus prestigieuse des coupes européennes, la Ligue des champions. Après avoir été membre du G14, organisation des clubs les plus importants et riches d'Europe, jusqu'à sa dissolution en janvier 2008, il fait partie des fondateurs de l'association européenne des clubs.\r\n\r\nAujourd'hui, il est considéré comme l'un des clubs majeurs du football européen, avec douze qualifications en Ligue des champions d'affilée. Depuis 2011, le club rhodanien se base de plus en plus sur son centre de formation.

Nel 2007 la sezione maschile e quella femminile vinsero i rispettivi campionati, consentendo al club di aggiudicarsi il titolo nazionale con entrambe le sezioni calcistiche, evento senza precedenti in Francia.\r\n\r\nDal 2016 la squadra calcistica del Lione disputa le partite interne nel Parc OL, stanziato nel comune di Décines-Charpieu, ubicato nella metropoli di Lione. Le partite delle selezioni minori del Lione e gli allenamenti della squadra maggiore sono invece svolti nel centro di allenamento Groupama OL.\r\n\r\nDalla fondazione del club i colori sociali sono rosso, blu e bianco, quest'ultimo predominante. Dall'avvento in società del presidente Jean-Michel Aulas, il completo tradizionale del club è una maglietta di colore bianco con strisce verticali rosse e blu. Lo stemma invece presenta una banda orizzontale superiore rossa che menziona su due righe la frase \"Olympique Lyonnais\". La parte inferiore, tinta di blu, indica le lettere OL foderate con bordature dorate e sfondo bianco; all'interno della lettera O viene raffigurato un leone dorato, simbolo della città di Lione. Il soprannome del club, Les Gones, significa \"i ragazzini\" nel dialetto regionale arpitano di Lione.\r\n\r\nNel proprio palmarès il Lione annovera 21 trofei nazionali - 7 campionati, 5 coppe nazionali, 1 coppa di lega e 8 supercoppe - che ne fanno il quarto club più titolato di Francia. A livello internazionale vanta invece una Coppa Intertoto (vinta nel 1997), una semifinale di Europa League 2016-2017, e dodici partecipazioni di fila alla UEFA Champions League (dal 1999-2000 al 2011-2012), dove il miglior risultato conseguito è la semifinale, raggiunta nel 2010 e nel 2020.\r\n\r\nForte rivalità sussiste con il Saint-Étienne, con cui il club lionese disputa il cosiddetto derby del Rodano, considerato tra i più importanti derby in Francia, per via della sentita contrapposizione fra le due principali squadre di calcio della regione Alvernia-Rodano-Alpi. Altra importante rivalità è quella con il Marsiglia, denominata Choc des Olympiques.\r\n\r\nIl club è quotato presso la borsa Euronext Paris con il nome di OL Groupe (Euronext: OLG) e ha anche una sezione femminile, che è la più titolata di Francia e tra le più titolate d'Europa e del mondo.",

It occasionally hosts RC Toulon rugby club of the Top 14. It is the largest club football ground in France, with a capacity of 67,344 spectators. The stadium is also used regularly by the French rugby union team.\r\n\r\nThe record attendance for a club game at the Stade Vélodrome was of 58,897 (for a UEFA Cup semi-final against Newcastle United in 2004). The stadium was also featured as a Football World Cup venue when the 1938 finals were held in France. The first-ever match to be played was between Marseille and Torino in 1937.\r\n\r\nThe French rugby union team began an impressive run of victories at the stadium in the early 2000s. They defeated the All Blacks 42–33 in November 2000, and in 2001 defeated Australia by one point. They beat the Springboks in 2002, followed by a win over England in 2003. However, their run of luck was broken in 2004 when they lost 14–24 to Argentina. The venue was used by France in November 2009 when the French played the New Zealand All Blacks. France is not the only rugby team to have used the Vélodrome in recent years. On April 18, 2009, Toulon took their home fixture in the Top 14 against Toulouse to the Vélodrome, drawing 57,039 spectators to see a 14–6 Toulon win which played a key role in the Toulonnais' successful fight against relegation in the 2008–09 season. Toulon has taken two home matches to the Vélodrome in each of the succeeding two seasons. The Vélodrome was also the venue for both semi-finals in the 2010–11 Top 14 season, and was used for the Toulon v Munster semi-final of the 2013–14 Heineken Cup.",

It serves primarily as a venue for football, being the home of AS Monaco and the Monaco national football team. From 1998-2012 this was the location of the annual UEFA Super Cup match. It is also used for track and field, where it formerly hosted the IAAF World Athletics Final (though certain events, such as the hammer, had to be held elsewhere, due to the stadium's relatively small capacity). On 29 July 2008, Yelena Isinbayeva set the women's pole vault world record of 5.04 metres at the ground.\r\n\r\nThe original Stade Louis II was opened in 1939 as the home of AS Monaco. The new stadium was built in the early 1980s, close to the site of the old stadium on land reclaimed from the sea, opening fully in 1985. It presently has a capacity of approximately 18,500 all seated, which is quite large relative to the population of Monaco (about 36,371); it can seat almost two-thirds of the country's population, a feat no other stadium can boast. The vast majority of the stadium's facilities are located underground, with a large car park directly under the pitch (something that has caused some degree of criticism from managers of AS Monaco's opponents in the past over the state of the pitch).\r\n\r\nThe stadium is named after Louis II, Prince of Monaco, who was the Sovereign Prince of Monaco when the original stadium was built. It features prominently in the early versions of Pro Evolution Soccer and Adidas Power Soccer 98.\r\n\r\nOn 1 July 2011, The Eagles played at the ground at the wedding of Prince Albert II to Charlene Wittstock.",

The venue, with a seating capacity of 48,712 spectators, has been the home of French football club Paris Saint-Germain since 1973. The current Parc des Princes was inaugurated on 4 June 1972, endowed with very avant-garde architecture for the period. Comfort and visibility were the key words of project architects Roger Taillibert and Siavash Teimouri. PSG became the resident club of the new stadium in June 1973 and its image and history has since been associated to Le Parc. Named after the Monarch's hunting grounds that it sits on, it was initially opened as a multi-purpose venue on 18 July 1897.\r\n\r\nThe Parc des Princes is the fourth largest football stadium in France. Originally a velodrome, it was the finish line of the Tour de France from the first event in 1903 until General Charles de Gaulle ordered the track demolished in the late 1960s. He decided in 1967 that the Parc des Princes should be dedicated to football and rugby games with a capacity of under 60,000 seats. The Parc des Princes was the national stadium of the France football team and the France rugby union team until the construction of the Stade de France for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The stadium and grounds are owned by the Paris city council and the Société d’Exploitation Sports-Evénements (SESE) holds the concession to the Parc des Princes since 1990.\r\n\r\nInitially a multi-task sports venue at first, it has hosted many major sports events. Le Parc was an Olympic site in the 1900 Games of the II Olympiad and hosted games in two FIFA World Cups. The stadium has also been the venue for two Euro finals, three UEFA Champions League finals, two UEFA Cup finals, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final, two Latin Cup finals, four USFSA championship finals, one Coupe Sheriff Dewar final, 33 French Cup finals, three League Cup finals, 30 Tournoi de Paris editions and 31 Top 14 finals. The ground has also hosted 128 football matches for the French national team, 59 Five Nations Championships games, one UCI Track Cycling World Championships and 54 Tour de France finishes. The stadium also witnessed the first live sports report in France and has even hosted boxing championships and music concerts. In recent times, the Parc des Princes has refocused on more medium-sized events as compared to the larger Stade de France.",

L'impianto utilizzato in precedenza, il Camp des Loges, ospita le partite delle selezioni minori del PSG e gli allenamenti della squadra maggiore. Come degna rappresentante della Ville Lumière, i colori sociali del club sono il blu, il rosso e il bianco, gli stessi della bandiera di Parigi. Fin dalla fondazione, il completo tradizionale del club è una maglietta di colore blu con una barra rossa al centro incorniciata da due linee bianche. Lo stemma invece rappresenta la Tour Eiffel stilizzata, sotto la quale c’è il fleur de lys (giglio), simbolo della città di Saint-Germain e della monarchia francese.\r\n\r\nNel suo palmarès annovera 42 titoli nazionali — 9 campionati, 14 Coppe nazionali, 9 Coppe di Lega e 10 Supercoppe — che ne fanno il club più titolato di Francia davanti a Olympique Marsiglia (25) e Saint-Étienne (22). A livello internazionale vanta invece una Coppe delle Coppe (vinta nel 1996) ed una Coppa Intertoto UEFA, che pone il PSG a pari merito con l'OM nella classifica dei club francesi per numero di vittorie in competizioni internazionali (2). Proprio con la formazione marsigliese sussiste la più accesa rivalità del calcio francese, denominata Le Classique. Nel 1994 il PSG fu nominato Squadra mondiale dell'anno dall'IFFHS.",

The club was founded in 1901 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football. Rennes plays its home matches at the Stade de la Route de Lorient located within the city. The team is managed by former football player Philippe Montanier and captained by defender Romain Danzé. The team's president is René Ruello and its owner is Artémis, the holding company of businessman François Pinault.\r\n\r\nRennes was founded in 1901 under the name Stade Rennais and is one of the most recognisable football clubs in the Brittany region, alongside former Brittany inhabitants Nantes. The two are among the main clubs that contest the Derby Breton. Rennes is one of the founding members of the first division of French football. Along with Marseille, Montpelllier, and Nice, Rennes is the only club to have played in the inaugural 1932–33 season and still be playing in the first division as of today. The club has, however, never won Ligue 1. The club's best finish in the league has been 4th with the club accomplishing this feat on four occasions; most recently in the 2006–07 season. Rennes have won two Coupe de France titles in 1965 and 1971. After winning the Coupe de France in 1971, Rennes changed its name to its current version.\r\n\r\nRennes is known for its youth academy, known in English as the Henri Guérin Training Centre, which was formed in 2000. The French Football Federation has regularly recognised the Rennes as having the best youth academy in the country. Rennes has finished in 1st place for the past two seasons. The patriarch of the academy is the under-19 team, which has won the Coupe Gambardella three times; in 1973, 2003, and 2008. The academy has produced several notable talents such as Sylvain Wiltord, Yoann Gourcuff, Yann M'Vila, Moussa Sow, and Jimmy Briand, among others.",

Dans un premier temps club omnisports, il porte le nom de Stade rennais jusqu'à sa fusion avec le Football-club rennais en 1904, devenant alors le Stade rennais université-club. Il dispute ses premières compétitions officielles à partir de 1902 au sein du Comité de Bretagne de l'Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques. En 1912, le club emménage sur un terrain situé au bord de la Vilaine, sur lequel est érigé l'actuel Stade de la route de Lorient.\r\n\r\nAprès avoir brillé dans les compétitions régionales, le Stade rennais se fait un nom au niveau national en atteignant la finale de la Coupe de France en 1922 et 1935. Au cours de cette période, en 1932, le club accède également au statut professionnel. Le stade rennais est l'un des membres fondateurs de la Première division du football français. Avec Marseille, Montpellier, Nice et Metz, Rennes est l'un des clubs qui a joué durant la saison inaugurale 1932-1933 et qui évolue encore en Ligue 1 aujourd'hui.\r\n\r\nDans les années 1960, il s'affirme, sous la houlette de son entraîneur Jean Prouff, comme l'une des meilleures équipes de l'hexagone, remportant par deux fois la Coupe de France en 1965 et 1971.\r\n\r\nCes bons résultats demeurent sans lendemain. Après avoir pris son indépendance vis-à-vis de la structure omnisports pour prendre son nom actuel en 1972, la section football connaît une longue traversée du désert sportive, ponctuée de graves difficultés financières. En 1998, la prise de contrôle de François Pinault et de sa holding Artémis transforme le club en société anonyme sportive professionnelle, permet sa modernisation, et le stabilise en Ligue 1.

Reims plays its home matches at the Stade Auguste Delaune, a renovation of the old complex located within the city. The team is managed by Hubert Fournier and captained by defender Mickaël Tacalfred.\r\n\r\nStade Reims is one of the most successful clubs in French football history having won six Ligue 1 titles, two Coupe de France trophies, and five Trophée des champions titles. The club has also performed well on European level having finished as runners-up in the 1956 and 1959 editions of the European Cup and winning the Latin Cup and Coppa delle Alpi in 1953 and 1977, respectively. However, since the 1980s, Reims have struggled to get back to their zenith. The club hovered between Ligue 2 and the Championnat National for over thirty years after their relegation from the top flight in the 1978–79 season. In 2012, though, they were promoted back to Ligue 1 where they currently remain.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Stade Reims is viewed as a legendary club within French football circles, not only due to its domestic and European accolades, but its charity towards the France national team through the 1940s and 50s, as well. Reims were largely responsible for the first Golden Generation of French football with notable national team members Roger Marche, Raymond Kopa, Just Fontaine, Jean Vincent, Robert Jonquet, Armand Penverne, Dominique Colonna, and Roger Piantoni all playing for Reims during the national team's successful run to the semi-finals at the 1958 FIFA World Cup.",

Champion de France amateur en 1935, le club opte pour le professionnalisme et intègre la deuxième division du championnat de France. En 1938, la fusion avec le Sporting Club Rémois, le grand rival local au maillot rouge et blanc, donne un nouvel élan à l'ensemble, qui est promu en première division à la sortie de la guerre.\r\n\r\nDans les années 1950, le Stade de Reims s'impose comme le principal club français, amassant en quelques années un palmarès prestigieux. Porté par des personnalités emblématiques (l'entraîneur Albert Batteux, le président Henri Germain ou encore le meneur de jeu Raymond Kopa), il remporte à six reprises le championnat de France et deux fois la coupe de France entre 1949 et 1962. Représentants français à la première édition de la Coupe des clubs champions européens en 1956, les coéquipiers du capitaine Robert Jonquet s'inclinent de justesse en finale face au Real Madrid. L’histoire se répète trois ans plus tard, face au même adversaire.\r\n\r\nLe licenciement de Batteux en 1963 coïncide avec le recul sportif du club, relégué en deuxième division en 1964 et 1967. De retour dans l'élite dans les années 1970, le club rémois ne parvient pas à retrouver l'éclat du passé, malgré les exploits de l'Argentin Carlos Bianchi. Sauvé de justesse de la faillite en 1978, relégué l'année suivante, il devient un pensionnaire régulier de la D2 jusqu'à sa liquidation judiciaire en 1991.\r\n\r\nLe Stade de Reims repart en Division d'honneur du Nord-Est, 6e échelon du football français, d'où il lui faudra dix saisons pour remonter en Ligue 2, où il se stabilise.

It has possessed professional status since 1933 and is currently playing the 2018–19 season in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football, after winning the 2016–17 Ligue 2 championship. This comes after the club was demoted to the fifth tier of French football at the conclusion of the 2010–11 Championnat National season after going into financial liquidation. Renamed RC Strasbourg Alsace, they won the CFA championship in 2012–13, and eventually became Championnat National champions in 2015–16.\r\n\r\nThe club's home stadium, since 1914, is Stade de la Meinau. They are managed by Thierry Laurey, who replaced Jacky Duguépéroux in May 2016.\r\n\r\nThe club is one of six clubs to have won all three major French trophies: the Championship in 1979, the Coupe de France in 1951, 1966 and 2001 and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1997 and 2005. Strasbourg is also among the six teams to have played more than 2,000 games in France's top flight (spanning 56 seasons) and has taken part in 52 European games since 1961. Despite these accomplishments, the club has never really managed to establish itself as one of France's leading clubs, experiencing relegation at least once a decade since the early 1950s. Racing has changed its manager 52 times in 75 years of professional play, often under pressure from the fans.\r\n\r\nThe destiny of the club has always been wedded to the history of Alsace. Like the region, Racing has changed nationality three times and has a troubled history. Founded in what was then a part of the German Empire, the club from the beginning insisted on its Alsatian and popular roots, in opposition to the first Strasbourg-based clubs which came from the German-born bourgeoisie. When Alsace was returned to France in 1919, the club changed its name from \"1. FC Neudorf\" to the current \"Racing club de Strasbourg\" in imitation of Pierre de Coubertin's Racing Club de France, a clear gesture of francophilia. Racing players lived through World War II as most Alsatians did: evacuated in 1939, annexed in 1940 and striving to avoid nazification and incorporation in the Wehrmacht between 1942 and 1944. When Alsace was definitively returned to France, Racing's identity switched towards Jacobinism with, for example, emotional wins in the cup in 1951 and 1966 amidst Franco-Alsatian controversies. More recently, the club has been eager to promote its European vocation along with its strong local ties.",

It is currently used mostly for football matches, mainly those of the Toulouse Football Club and the big games of rugby for Stade Toulousain in the European Rugby Champions Cup or Top 14. It also hosts the test matches of France's national rugby union team. It is located on the island of Ramier near the centre of Toulouse. It is a pure football and rugby ground, and therefore has no athletics track surrounding the field. The stadium is able to hold 33,150 people.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was built in 1937 for the 1938 FIFA World Cup (but again under construction, the World Cup matches were playing in the Stade du T.O.E.C., 4 kilometers further North) and has undergone two extensive renovations, in 1949 and 1997.\r\n\r\nThe stadium staged six matches during the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nIt was also used as a host venue during the 2007 Rugby World Cup for games such as Japan-Fiji, won by the latter 35–31. On 13 November 2009 the stadium hosted international rugby again when France hosted South Africa. At the time, South Africa were leading the series by 20 wins to 10 (6 drawn).\r\n\r\nMichael Jackson performed in front of 40,000 people during his Dangerous World Tour on 16 September 1992.",

After 38 days in Buffalo, the team moved to Moline, Illinois, where they were renamed the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. In 1949, they joined the NBA as part of the merger between the NBL and the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and briefly had Red Auerbach as coach. In 1951, Kerner moved the team to Milwaukee, where they changed their name to the Hawks. Kerner and the team moved again in 1955 to St. Louis, where they won their only NBA Championship in 1958 and qualified to play in the NBA Finals in 1957, 1960 and 1961. The Hawks played the Boston Celtics in all four of their trips to the NBA Finals. The St. Louis Hawks moved to Atlanta in 1968, when Kerner sold the franchise to Thomas Cousins and former Georgia Governor Carl Sanders.\r\n\r\nThe Hawks currently own the second-longest drought (behind the Sacramento Kings) of not winning an NBA championship at 63 seasons. The franchise's lone NBA championship, as well as all four NBA Finals appearances, occurred when the team was based in St. Louis. Meanwhile, they went 48 years without advancing past the second round of the playoffs in any format, until finally breaking through in 2015. However, the Hawks are one of only four NBA teams that have qualified to play in the NBA playoffs in 10 consecutive seasons in the 21st century. They achieved this feat between 2008 and 2017.",

Quando a NBL se fundiu com a Basketball Association of America para formar a National Basketball Association, os Blackhawks chegaram aos playoffs no ano inaugural da NBA, sob a liderança do técnico Red Auerbach. Em 1951, a franquia foi transferida para Milwaukee, Wisconsin, tendo o nome encurtado para Hawks. Em 1953, o time contratou Bob Pettit, um futuro MVP. Apesar disto, o Hawks foi um dos piores times na temporada, e em 1955 a franquia se mudou novamente, desta vez para St. Louis, Missouri.\r\n\r\n1954-67: St. Louis\r\nEm St. Louis, os Hawks se tornaram uma das equipes mais fortes da NBA, falhando apenas uma vez em se classificar para a pós-temporada com jogadores como Bob Pettit, Lenny Wilkens e Ed Macauley (que passou sua última temporada em 1958-59 como técnico-jogador antes de assumir o banco de vez no ano seguinte). No segundo ano do time em Missouri começou uma série de quatro finais em cinco anos, todas contra o Boston Celtics. A segunda destas, em 1958, garantiu o único título da história da franquia, ajudados pelo líder dos Celtics Bill Russell se machucar no que seria sua única final perdida. Apesar da equipe competitiva, o dono Ben Kerner estava insatisfeito de jogar no pequeno Kiel Auditorium e ocasionalmente na imensa mas ultrapassada St. Louis Arena, e a cidade negava suas tentativas de construir um novo ginásio. Eventualmente Kerner vendeu a equipe para dois empresários de Atlanta, Tom Cousins e Carl Sanders, que mudaram o time para a Geórgia.\r\n\r\n1968-presente: Atlanta\r\nEnquanto se construía um novo ginásio, os Hawks jogavam no Alexander Memorial Coliseum, sede do time de basquete da Georgia Tech. A equipe começou os anos 70 competitivos sob os atletas Pete Maravich e Lou Hudson, e se mudaram em 1972 para o Omni Coliseum - dividido com uma equipe da NHL, o Atlanta Flames e parte do atual complexo CNN Center. Durante um período de reconstrução no fim da década, em 1977 o empresário de televisão e dono do time de beisebol Atlanta Braves Ted Turner comprou os Hawks em 1977. Turner ajudou a manter a equipe no sul dos Estados Unidos, e garantia muita exposição em seus canais.\r\n\r\nDurante a década de 1980, os Hawks se tornaram uma das equipes mais fortes da NBA sob o técnico Mike Fratello e a liderança do especialista em enterradas Dominique Wilkins e o baixinho Spud Webb, fechando 5 temporadas seguidas com mais de 50 vitórias. A década de 1990 viu algumas boas temporadas com atletas como Dikembe Mutombo e Stacey Augmon, enquanto se construía uma nova arena a ser dividida com uma franquia da NHL. A Philips Arena foi inaugurada em 1999.\r\n\r\nO novo ginásio viu o período mais improdutivo dos Hawks, que ficaram 8 anos seguidos sem se classificar para os playoffs. A situação mudou após conseguir Joe Johnson do Phoenix Suns em 2005, que liderou em 2007-08 uma equipe que incluía o novato Al Horford e os experientes Zaza Pachulia, Josh Smith, e Marvin Williams e conseguiram a última vaga no Leste, antes de forçar os eventuais campeões Boston Celtics a jogarem sete jogos antes de eliminarem Atlanta. Os Hawks desde então nunca perderam a pós-temporada, se reinventando com aquisições como Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver e Paul Millsap.

          "strDescriptionEN": "The Boston Celtics (ˈsɛlˌtɪks) are an American professional basketball franchise based in Boston, Massachusetts. They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Founded in 1946 and one of eight NBA teams (out of 23 total teams) to survive the league's first decade, the team is currently owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins. The franchise's seventeen championships are the most for any NBA franchise, and account for 25.4% of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946. This makes the Boston Celtics the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports.\r\n\r\nThe Celtics have met the Lakers a record twelve times in the Finals, including their most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010, with the Celtics winning nine and Lakers winning three. Four Celtics (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of ten MVP awards. Their mascot 'Lucky the Leprechaun' is a nod to the team's Irish heritage and to Boston's historically large Irish population.\r\n\r\nThe Celtics rose again after struggling through the 1990s to win a championship in 2008 with the help of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen. During this time, point guard Rajon Rondo developed into a perennial all-star. Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett were later traded to the Brooklyn Nets.",

It sits partially on a platform over the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)-owned Vanderbilt Yards rail yard at Atlantic Avenue for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). It is part of a ${'$'}4.9 billion future business and residential complex now known as Pacific Park.\r\n\r\nThe site is located adjacent to the newly renamed MTA Atlantic Avenue – Barclays Center subway station (2 3 4 5 B D N Q R trains) and the LIRR’s Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn. The arena hosts the National Basketball Association’s Brooklyn Nets, along with concerts, conventions and other sporting events. The venue competes with other facilities in the New York metropolitan area, including Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, Prudential Center in Newark, and Izod Center in East Rutherford. Beginning in 2015, it will also be the home of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League. The arena and the Brooklyn Nets are owned by Mikhail Prokhorov's American holdings.\r\n\r\nInitially proposed in 2004 when real estate developer Bruce Ratner purchased the Nets for ${'$'}300 million as the first step of the process to build a new home for the team, the development of the arena experienced significant hurdles along the way. Its use of eminent domain and its potential environmental impact stirred up community resistance, especially as residential buildings and businesses such as the Ward Bakery were to be demolished and large amounts of public subsidies were used, which led to multiple lawsuits. The global recession of 2009 also caused financing for the project to dry up. As a result, the start of construction was delayed for many years and at times in danger of not happening at all. Groundbreaking for construction occurred on March 11, 2010, and the arena was opened to the public on September 21, 2012, which was also attended by some 200 protesters. It held its first event with a Jay Z concert on September 28, 2012.",

It is owned by the city of Charlotte, and operated by the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA. It made its grand opening in October 2005 as the Charlotte Bobcats Arena, with a concert by The Rolling Stones and hosted its first Bobcats game on November 5, 2005. The arena's center-hung video screen, known as \"Hornets TV\", measures 16 feet by 28 feet, the largest of any indoor arena.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 2008, the Hornets, then known as the Bobcats, announced a naming rights deal with Time Warner Cable, the area's largest cable television provider, to rename the arena. As part of the deal, the Bobcats ended a somewhat restrictive deal that kept them off satellite and regional cable television. The change became effective immediately, with printed tickets for the Bobcats' April 8, 2008 game against the Minnesota Timberwolves reflecting the arena's new name and the game airing on FSN South.\r\n\r\nThe arena seats 19,077 for most NBA games, but can be expanded to seat up to 20,200 for college basketball games (and presumably NBA playoff games). The arena also serves as home to the Charlotte Checkers, an ice hockey team that plays in the AHL. When the Checkers play there, capacity is reduced to 14,100 (though 4,000 of those seats have obstructed views)",

          "strDescriptionEN": "The Cleveland Cavaliers, also known as the Cavs, are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. The Cavs compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Quicken Loans Arena in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League and the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005.\r\n\r\nThe Cavaliers opened their inaugural season losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than 6th in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by five coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to ${'$'}15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66–180 in that time, never better than 8th in the conference, and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons. Stepien's repeated trades of the team's first overall draft pick led to the NBA creating the \"Stepien rule\" to prevent such trades.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender, led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty, and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in 1998, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons, finishing no better than 9th in the conference. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history, followed by division titles in 2008 and 2009, the first division titles since 1976. After the 2009–10 season, however, James signed with the Miami Heat and the Cavaliers finished the 2010–11 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak that, as of 2017, ranks as the longest in NBA history for a single season and second overall. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery three times, first in 2011 where they selected Kyrie Irving, and again in 2013 and 2014.\r\n\r\nLeBron James returned to the Cavs in 2014–15 and led the team back to the playoffs for the first time since 2010, where they claimed their second Eastern Conference championship. The following season, Cleveland again won the Eastern Conference and returned to the NBA Finals, where they won their first NBA championship and first major sports title in the city since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing three games to one. Through the 2016–17 season, the Cavs have made 21 playoff appearances, and won six Central Division titles, four Eastern Conference titles, and one NBA title.",

The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971. The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.\r\n\r\nThe Warriors won the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947, and won again in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trio Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil Johnston. After the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain in January 1965, the team finished the 1964–65 season with the NBA's worst record (17–63). Their rebuilding period was brief due in large part to the Warriors' drafting of Rick Barry four months after the trade. In 1975, star players Barry and Jamaal Wilkes powered the Warriors to their third championship, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.\r\n\r\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". The team returned to championship glory in 2015, led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green; they won again in 2017 and 2018 (with the help of former MVP Kevin Durant) and again in 2022.\r\n\r\nNicknamed the \"Dubs\" as a shortening of \"W's\", the Warriors hold several NBA records: best regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), and best postseason run. Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time. The Warriors have the third most NBA championships and have the third most Finals appearances; only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics have more. The Warriors are the second most valuable NBA franchise and the sixth-highest valued sports franchise in the world, with an estimated value of ${'$'}4.7 billion.",

However, he was denied by arena owner Chuck Watson, then-owner of the Aeros, who also wanted control of a new arena. The two sides agreed to equal control over an arena in a deal signed in 1997, but the proposal was rejected by city voters in a 1999 referendum. It was not until the city and the Rockets signed an amended agreement in 2001, excluding the Aeros, that the proposal was accepted.\r\n\r\nConstruction began in July 2001, and the new arena was officially opened in September 2003. The total costs were ${'$'}235 million, with the city of Houston paying the majority, and the Rockets paying for enhancements. Toyota paid ${'$'}100 million for the naming rights.",

The team plays in the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was established in 1967 and played in San Diego, California for four years as the San Diego Rockets, before moving to Houston in 1971.\r\n\r\nIn the Rockets' debut season, they won only 15 games. But after drafting Elvin Hayes first overall in the 1969 NBA Draft, they made their first appearance in the playoffs in 1969. After Hayes was traded, Moses Malone was later acquired to replace him. Malone went on to win the MVP award twice, and lead Houston to the conference finals in his first year with the team. He also took the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981, but they were defeated in six games by Larry Bird's Boston Celtics which also featured the Rockets current head coach, Kevin McHale.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, the Rockets drafted Hakeem Olajuwon who, paired with Ralph Sampson and both collectively known as the \"Twin Towers\", led them to the 1986 Finals in their second and third year respectively, where in another brave effort they lost again to the Boston Celtics. In the next seven seasons, plagued by injury including to Sampson who would be traded in 1988, they lost in the first round of the playoffs five times, until finally advancing in 1993 with a re-tooled roster past the L.A. Clippers and battle the rival Seattle SuperSonics to the bitter end before falling short in an overtime Game 7. Inspired by the tough playoff defeat, Olajuwon famously proclaimed to the team \"We go from here.\" The Rockets stormed all the way to the 1994 NBA Finals, where Olajuwon led them to the franchise's first championship against his rival Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks. The team repeated as champions in 1995 with a memorable run as the 6th seed in the West and sweeping the favored Orlando Magic led by a young Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway. After winning two championships, the Rockets traded away most of the championship team for Charles Barkley, changed their championship uniforms, and, to date, have not advanced to the finals again. They missed the playoffs from 2000–2003 and did not reach the playoffs again until they drafted Yao Ming, and did not advance past the first round of the playoffs again until 2009. The Rockets narrowly missed the playoffs the following three seasons. After Yao Ming's retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The recent acquisitions of franchise players James Harden and Dwight Howard have helped launch the Rockets back into playoff contention.",

Later that same season, the Pacers made it to the 2000 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. Three games of that championship series were held at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, but the Pacers ended up losing that season's title 4 games to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bankers Life Fieldhouse was the site for the 2009 WNBA Finals. The Indiana Fever took on the Phoenix Mercury for games three and four of that series, but ended up losing the series. Three years later, the Fever hosted the 2012 WNBA Finals for games 3 & 4 and beat the Minnesota Lynx.\r\n\r\nBankers Life Fieldhouse is a host venue for many different events besides home games for the Pacers and Fever. From 2002 to 2007, the venue served as the site of the Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament in even numbered years while the tournament was held at the United Center in Chicago in odd numbered years. In 2008, the tournament was moved to Bankers Life Fieldhouse exclusively for five years, through 2012. The arena is also a frequent site of the Big Ten Women's Basketball Tournament. 2012 will mark the 12th time in 13 years that the tournament has been held at the Fieldhouse. On June 5, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced that beginning in 2013 the location of both of the conference basketball tournaments for the following four years would be alternated between the Chicago area and Indianapolis. Bankers Life Fieldhouse will once again be the site for both men's and women's events in 2014 and 2016. The 2011 NCAA Women's Final Four was also held at the Fieldhouse on April 3 and April 5 of 2011. For basketball, the venue seats 18165 (18345 from 1999 to 2006).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Indiana Firebirds of the Arena Football League played at the Fieldhouse from 2001 to 2004. The venue also hosts select games for the Indiana Ice of the United States Hockey League.\r\n\r\nThe Professional Bull Riders brought its Built Ford Tough Series bull riding tour to the Fieldhouse for the first time in January 2011. It was their second visit to Indianapolis; they first visited Indianapolis during the 2004 season when they held a BFTS event at the RCA Dome.",

          "strDescriptionEN": "The Los Angeles Clippers (branded as the LA Clippers) are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Clippers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division in the league's Western Conference. They play their home games at the Staples Center, an arena they share with fellow NBA team Los Angeles Lakers, as well as the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL).\r\n\r\nThe franchise was founded as the Buffalo Braves in 1970 as an expansion team. Led by future Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo, the Braves reached the playoffs three times during their eight seasons in Buffalo. Conflicts with the Canisius Golden Griffins over the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and the sale of the franchise led to their relocation from Buffalo to San Diego, California in 1978. Rebranded as the San Diego Clippers after the sailing ships seen in the San Diego Bay, the team saw little success and missed the playoffs during all six of their years in San Diego.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, the franchise was controversially relocated to Los Angeles by new owner Donald Sterling without NBA approval. Despite the NBA taking legal action against Sterling and threatening to dissolve the franchise if he did not return the franchise to San Diego, the team was ultimately permitted to remain in Los Angeles, thanks to a counter-lawsuit initiated by Sterling. Over the course of its first 27 seasons in LA, the Clippers qualified for the postseason only four times and won only a single playoff round. They were frequently considered a perennial loser in American professional sports, drawing unfavorable comparisons to the historically successful Lakers.\r\n\r\nThe Clippers' reputation improved during the 2010s, which saw them transform into consistent postseason contenders. Aided by the \"Lob City\" lineup of Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul, the team qualified to play in the NBA playoffs in five consecutive seasons from 2011 to 2017 and won two consecutive division titles in 2013 and 2014, both firsts for the franchise. Despite this success, the Clippers have struggled in the postseason and never advanced past the conference semifinals round. They are the oldest franchise to have never played in the NBA Finals.",

          "strDescriptionEN": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles, California. They play in the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center. The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA, and have won 16 NBA championships, their last being in 2010. As of 2013, the Lakers are the second most valuable NBA franchise according to Forbes, having an estimated value of ${'$'}1 billion.\r\n\r\nThe franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team, the Detroit Gems of the NBL. The new team began playing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers in honor of the state's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Initially a member of the National Basketball League, the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America and winning five of the next six BAA and NBA championships in Minneapolis after the NBA formed in 1949. The team was propelled by center George Mikan, who is described by the NBA's official website as the league's \"first superstar\". After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan's retirement, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season.\r\n\r\nLed by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West, Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost each series to the Boston Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four time MVP Wilt Chamberlain to play center, and after losing in the Finals in 1969 and 1970, they won their sixth NBA title—and first in Los Angeles—in 1972, led by new head coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of West and Chamberlain, the team acquired another center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won multiple MVP awards, but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s. The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to their Magic Johnson-led fast break-offense, and won five championships in a nine-year span, including their first ever Finals championship against the Celtics in 1985. This team featured Hall of Famers in Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy, and a Hall of Fame coach, Pat Riley. After Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson's retirement, the team struggled in the early 1990s before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996. Led by O'Neal, Bryant, and another Hall of Fame coach, Phil Jackson, Los Angeles won three consecutive titles between 2000 to 2002, securing the franchise its second \"three-peat\". After losing both the 2004 and 2008 NBA Finals, the Lakers won two more championships by defeating the Orlando Magic in 2009 and Boston in 2010.\r\n\r\nThe Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set during the 1971–72 season. Sixteen Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Four Lakers—Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant—have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Awards for a total of eight awards.",

The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden, above Pennsylvania Station in the borough of Manhattan, and along with the Boston Celtics is one of only two original NBA teams still located in its original city.\r\n\r\nThe Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter. It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two championship titles in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.\r\n\r\nThe playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by three passionate rivalries with Alonzo Mourning's Miami Heat, Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, and Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. During this time, they were well known for displaying tough defense under head coach Pat Riley before Jeff Van Gundy assumed head coaching responsibilities in 1995. Their success during this decade was highlighted by two appearances in the NBA Finals, in 1994 and 1999. Despite being a consistent playoff contender, they never attained an NBA Championship in their two championship appearances.\r\n\r\nSince 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former glory, advancing to the playoffs five times in the last 14 years. In 2012–13, the franchise won its first division title in 19 years, but were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Indiana Pacers. According to Forbes, the Knicks are the 2nd-most-valuable NBA team, worth approximately ${'$'}2.5 billion U.S.",

The arena was also the home of the Central Hockey League (CHL)'s Oklahoma City Blazers until the team folded in July 2009, and the home of the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz arena football team, which moved to the Cox Convention Center.\r\n\r\nIt is owned by the city and operated by the SMG property management company.\r\n\r\nOf special note, Chesapeake Energy Arena (then known as the Ford Center) served as the temporary home for the NBA's New Orleans Hornets (now known as the Pelicans) when they were forced to play games elsewhere following the decimation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. The response in the two seasons the Hornets played in Oklahoma City (2005–07) was an impetus to Oklahoma City being discussed prior to 2008 as a future NBA city, either by relocation or expansion.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its use as a sports venue, Chesapeake Energy Arena hosts concerts, family and social events, conventions, ice shows, and civic events.",

In Oklahoma City, the Thunder qualified for their first playoff berth during the 2009–10 season.

          "strStadiumDescription": "Talking Stick Resort Arena (formerly America West Arena and US Airways Center) is a sports and entertainment arena in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. It opened on June 6, 1992 at a construction cost of ${'$'}89 million.\r\n\r\nIt is home to the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Phoenix Mercury of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the Arena Football League's Arizona Rattlers.\r\n\r\nThe ECHL's Phoenix RoadRunners played at the arena from their inaugural 2005-06 season until they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 2008-09 season.\r\n\r\nLocated near Chase Field (the Arizona Diamondbacks' home ballpark), the arena is one million square feet in size on an 11-acre site. These two major league sports venues make up for half of those used by Phoenix area professional teams, the other two being University of Phoenix Stadium and Gila River Arena (formerly Jobing.com Arena) in the neighboring Phoenix suburb of Glendale.\r\n\r\nRenovations were completed in March 2003, where it features a 16,000-square foot air-conditioned glass-enclosed atrium built on the northwest side of the arena. It is to keep patrons cool while waiting in line for tickets or spending time inside the building before events. The total cost was estimated around ${'$'}67 million. The upgrading of US Airways Center was done as part of the Phoenix Suns' plan to keep it economically competitive after Jobing.com Arena opened. Former Suns owner Jerry Colangelo originally thought of the renovations after visiting Staples Center in Los Angeles and envisioned a similar entertainment district in Phoenix.\r\n\r\nThe arena also features the Verve Lounge, a high-class exclusive bar lounge.",

The Suns compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member team of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division, and are the only team in their division not to be based in California. Since 1992, the Suns have played their home games at Talking Stick Resort Arena in downtown Phoenix.\r\n\r\nThe Suns began play as an expansion team in 1968. The franchise owns the NBA's fourth-best all-time winning percentage, winning 55 percent of its games, as of the end of the 2014–15 season. In 47 years of play, they have made the playoffs 29 times, posted 19 seasons of 50 or more wins, made nine trips to the Western Conference Finals, and advanced to the NBA Finals twice, in 1976 and 1993. As a result, the Suns are the team with the highest all-time win-loss percentage to have never won an NBA championship.\r\n\r\nWith the National Hockey League's Phoenix Coyotes changing their geographic location name to Arizona on June 27, 2014, which was required as part of their new Gila River Arena lease agreement, the Suns are the only men's major professional sports franchise based in the state of Arizona that brands themselves exclusively to the city of Phoenix rather than the state as a whole.",

It is suitable for large indoor events of all sorts, including basketball, ice hockey, rodeos, circuses, conventions, ice shows, concerts, and dramatic productions. The arena has a capacity of 19,441 spectators when configured for basketball, fewer for other events. The arena is equipped with state-of-the-art acoustics and other amenities.\r\n\r\nIt is owned by Vulcan Inc., a holding company owned by Paul Allen, and is currently managed by Anschutz Entertainment Group and AEG Live. The primary tenant is the Portland Trail Blazers NBA franchise, also owned by Allen. The other major tenant of the building today is the major junior hockey franchise Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League, which splits its schedule with the Memorial Coliseum next door. In addition to the Blazers and Winterhawks, several other professional sports franchises, and the Portland State University men's basketball team, either currently play home games in Moda Center, or have done so in the past. In addition, Moda Center is a popular venue for concerts and other artistic productions.\r\n\r\nConstruction began in 1993, and the arena opened on October 12, 1995. The arena cost US${'$'}262 million to build; construction was financed with funds obtained by a variety of sources, including the City of Portland, Allen's personal fortune, and ${'$'}155 million in bonds issued by a consortium of mutual funds and insurance companies. These bonds would become the subject of an acrimonious 2004 bankruptcy in which the Oregon Arena Corporation, the holding company which owned the arena at the time, would forfeit title to the arena in lieu of repaying the bonds per the payment terms. Allen would later repurchase the arena from the creditors in 2007.",

They play in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Trail Blazers played their home games in the Memorial Coliseum before moving to Moda Center in 1995 (called the Rose Garden until 2013). The franchise entered the league in 1970, and Portland has been its only home city. The franchise has enjoyed a strong following; from 1977 through 1995, the team sold out 814 consecutive home games, the longest such streak in American major professional sports at the time, only since surpassed by the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox. The Trail Blazers have been the only NBA team based in the binational Pacific Northwest, after the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis and became the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, and the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe team has advanced to the NBA Finals three times, winning the NBA Championship once in 1977. Their other NBA Finals appearances were in 1990 and 1992. The team has qualified for the playoffs in 30 seasons of their 44-season existence, including a streak of 21 straight appearances from 1983 through 2003, the second longest streak in NBA history. Six Hall of Fame players have played for the Trail Blazers (Lenny Wilkens, Bill Walton, Clyde Drexler, Dražen Petrović, Arvydas Sabonis, and Scottie Pippen). Bill Walton is the franchise's most decorated player; he was the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player in 1977, and the regular season MVP the following year. Four Blazer rookies (Geoff Petrie, Sidney Wicks, Brandon Roy and Damian Lillard) have won the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Two Hall of Fame coaches, Lenny Wilkens and Jack Ramsay, have patrolled the sidelines for the Blazers, and two others, Mike Schuler and Mike Dunleavy, have won the NBA Coach of the Year award with the team.",

They jumped to the Basketball Association of America, forerunner of the NBA, in 1948. As the Royals, the team was often successful on the court, winning the NBA championship in 1951. However, they found it increasingly difficult to turn a profit in the comparatively small market of Rochester, and relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1957, becoming the Cincinnati Royals. In 1972, the team relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, initially splitting their games between Kansas City and Omaha, Nebraska, and taking up the name Kansas City Kings. The team again failed to find success in that market, and moved to Sacramento in 1985. After the San Antonio Spurs lost the 2013 NBA Finals to the Miami Heat in seven games, the Kings are the only franchise to never trail in a single NBA Finals series.",

They are the current NBA champions.\r\n\r\nThe Spurs are one of four former American Basketball Association teams to remain intact in the NBA after the 1976 ABA–NBA merger and the only former ABA team to have won an NBA championship. The Spurs' five NBA championships are the fourth most in history behind only the Boston Celtics (17), Los Angeles Lakers (16), and Chicago Bulls (6). The Spurs currently rank second among active franchises for the highest winning percentage in NBA history trailing only the Los Angeles Lakers, and are the only team in the NBA with a tied or better head-to-head regular season record against every active NBA franchise.\r\n\r\nIn their 38 NBA seasons since 1976–1977, the Spurs have won 20 division titles. They have made the playoffs in 24 of the last 25 seasons (since 1989–1990) and have missed the playoffs four times since entering the NBA; they have not missed the playoffs in the 17 seasons since Tim Duncan was drafted by the Spurs in 1997. With their 50th win in the 2013–2014 season, the Spurs extended their record for most consecutive 50+ win seasons to 15 (the 1998/1999 season was shortened to 50 games because of a lockout and based on their win percentage of .740, would have easily surpassed 50 wins in an 82-game season, and thus extend the record by 2 more seasons). Only the team's current head coach, Gregg Popovich, who had been the team's general manager before replacing Bob Hill in 1996, has had a longer tenure with the Spurs.",

          "strStadiumDescription": "The Air Canada Centre (ACC) (French: Centre Air Canada) is a multi-purpose indoor sporting arena located on Bay Street in the South Core district of Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). It was also home to the Toronto Phantoms of the Arena Football League (AFL) during their brief existence. The arena is popularly known as the ACC or the Hangar (the latter nickname came from its sponsorship by Air Canada).\r\n\r\nThe arena is owned and operated by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE), the same group that owns both the Leafs and Raptors, and is 665,000 square feet (61,800 square metres) in size. In 2008, the ACC was the fifth busiest arena in the world and the busiest in Canada. Air Canada Centre is connected to Union Station and the underground pedestrian PATH system, providing access to public transportation (TTC's Union subway station and GO Transit). There are also 13,000 parking spaces.\r\n\r\nThe Air Canada Centre has, from its initial design to completion, revolutionized many concepts included in new arenas and stadiums built since then. These features include luxury suites accessible on the ground floor, splitting the main scoreboard into several sections, rotating all sponsor signage in the bowl at once (to allow dominant messaging), and multiple restaurants in and out of the main arena bowl view.",

          "strDescriptionEN": "The Toronto Raptors are a Canadian professional basketball team based in Toronto, Ontario, that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Raptors are part of the league's Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team was established in 1995, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada. When the Grizzlies relocated to Memphis, Tennessee to become the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, the Raptors became the only Canadian team in the NBA. They originally played their home games at the SkyDome (later renamed Rogers Centre), before moving along Bremner Boulevard to the Air Canada Centre in 1999.\r\n\r\nLike most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft day trade in 1998, the team set league attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to a then-franchise high 47 wins and their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. During the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, they failed to make significant progress and he was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets.\r\n\r\nAfter Carter left, Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader. In 2006–07, Bryan Colangelo's first full season as President and General Manager, a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall NBA draft pick Andrea Bargnani and a revamp of the roster helped the Raptors qualify for their first playoff berth in five years, capturing the Atlantic Division title with 47 wins. In the 2007–08 season, they advanced to the playoffs again, but failed to make the playoffs in each of the next five seasons. In a bid to persuade Bosh to stay, Colangelo overhauled the team roster for the 2009–10 season, but Bosh signed with the Miami Heat in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\r\n\r\nAfter Masai Ujiri was brought in as the new General Manager in 2013, he traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks. With a backcourt led by Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors returned to the playoffs, won their second Atlantic Division title, and won a franchise record 48 games in the 2013–14 season. However, they failed for a fourth consecutive time to advance beyond the first round of the playoffs.",

The arena seats 19,911 for basketball, has 56 luxury suites, and 668 club seats.\r\n\r\nOpened in 1991, the arena was known as the Delta Center, until EnergySolutions purchased the naming rights, after Delta Air Lines declined to renew their 15 year contact, effective November 20, 2006.\r\n\r\nThe arena is the home of the NBA's Utah Jazz.\r\n\r\nThe arena was also home to the figure skating and short track speed skating competitions of the 2002 Winter Olympics (during the Olympics, the arena was referred to as the Salt Lake Ice Center).\r\nThe arena was originally imagined as 20,000-seat home for the Utah Jazz and Salt Lake Golden Eagles to replace the since-demolished Salt Palace arena, which had 12,616 seats. Under the leadership and private financing of Utah businessman Larry H. Miller, ground was broken on May 22, 1990, and it was completed on October 4, 1991 in time for late-October basketball games, at a cost of ${'$'}93 million.\r\n\r\nThe first game played in the arena was a Golden Eagles match against the Peoria Rivermen on October 16, 1991, which the home team lost 4–2. The Eagles had also played the inaugural game in the Salt Palace when it opened on October 10, 1969. The Eagles, which were purchased by Miller in 1990, lost nearly a million dollars annually and would not long play in the Delta Center.\r\n\r\nThe first basketball game played in the arena was a Jazz pre-season loss against Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks, 101–95. In addition to sports, the arena was intended to host large music concerts. On October 24, 1991, Oingo Boingo became the first headlining act to rock the Delta Center.",

They are a part of the Northwest Division in the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise began in 1974 as the New Orleans Jazz in New Orleans, Louisiana; the team moved to Salt Lake City in 1979.\r\n\r\nThe Jazz were one of the least successful teams in the league in their early years. Although it took the Jazz 10 years before they made a playoff appearance (in 1984), they would not miss the playoffs again until 2004. During the late 1980s, John Stockton and Karl Malone arose as the franchise players for the team, and formed one of the most famed point guard–power forward duos in NBA history. Led by coach Jerry Sloan, who took over for Frank Layden in 1988, they became one of the powerhouse teams of the 1990s, culminating in two NBA Finals appearances in 1997 and 1998, where they lost both times to the Chicago Bulls, led by Michael Jordan.\r\n\r\nBoth Stockton and Malone moved on in 2003. After missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons the Jazz returned to prominence under the on-court leadership of point guard Deron Williams. However, partway through the 2010–11 NBA season, the Jazz began a restructuring after Sloan's retirement and Williams' trade to the New Jersey Nets. The team has made the playoffs since then: in 2012 under coach Tyrone Corbin, and are beginning a new era under head coach Quin Snyder.\r\n\r\nThe Jazz are one of two teams in the major professional sports leagues located in the state of Utah; the other team is Real Salt Lake, a professional soccer team in Major League Soccer (MLS).",

Le club intègre la deuxième division en 1970, puis découvre enfin la première division en 1979. Il connaît son apogée sportif entre 1981 et 1991, sous la présidence de François Yvinec, en disputant neuf saisons dans l'élite en dix ans. En 1991, le club est rétrogradé avant de déposer le bilan quelques mois plus tard. Le club ne retrouve la deuxième division qu'en 2004 et la Ligue 1 en 2010. À la fin de la saison 2012-2013, il compte respectivement treize et dix-sept exercices en première et deuxième division française2.\r\n\r\nLe club brestois est présidé depuis le 31 mai 2013 par l'entrepreneur brestois Yvon Kermarec.
